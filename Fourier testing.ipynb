    "## mathematicl defenition and intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started let us show the next definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i \\sin(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the Continuos Time Fourier Transform (CTFT) for a given function x(t) is as follows:\n",
    "$$ X(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x\\} (f) = CTFT\\{x\\}(f) \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-i 2 \\pi f t} dt $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us get some intuition for this definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the definition of inner product on the space of complex functions:\n",
    "$$ \\langle g,h \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(x) h^{*}(x) dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also recall that performing inner product between two vectors $u,v$ is basically projecting one onto another.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that in mind, we can see that the value of the fourier transform at frequency $f_0$ is actually (up to some constant):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X(f_0) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x\\}(f_0) = \\langle x, h_{f_0} \\rangle$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $h_{f_0} = e^{i 2 \\pi f_0 t}$ is the harmony coresponding to frequency $f_0$\n",
    "So basically, CTFT measures for every frequency, what is the projection of our beloved function $x(t)$ on this frequency, or the correlation between our function and $h_{f_0}$ - Imagine the harmonies as our ingredients. CTFT tells us how many of each \"ingredient\" to put in our bowl in order to get the wanted $x(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we use this recipe to get $x(t)$? This is exactly the inverse transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x(t) = ICTFT\\{X\\}(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(f) e^{i 2 \\pi f t} df $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the inverse transform is very similar to the regular fourier transform and this is not just luck!\n",
    "The fourier transform posseses the following property (called unitarity):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{F} (x)) = x^{*} (-t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically this property's meaning is that up to complex conjugation and mirroring, fourier transform and its inverse are basically the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of common fourier transfoems:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = e^{i 2 \\pi f_0 t} \\xrightarrow{}{} X(f) = \\delta(f-f_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\cos (2 \\pi f_0 t) \\xrightarrow{}{} X(f) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\delta(f-f_0) + \\delta(f+f_0)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = e^{-\\alpha t^2} \\xrightarrow{}{} X(f) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} e^{-\\frac{(\\pi f)^2}{\\alpha}}$$\n",

    "## Sampling and Descretization\n",
    "\n",
    "So integrals are SUPERRRRR AMAZINGGGGG but, unfortunately, integrals, and continuos functions and operations are not objects that we can represent in computers. In order to utilize fourier analysis for digital use, we will have to take two steps that will help us getting fourier on our screen. (However, remember that nothing comes without a cost!! ):\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Sampling (the signal)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Discretizing (the transform)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Sampling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "So we want to go from a continuous time signal: $\\{ x(t) | -\\infty < t< \\infty \\}$ to a set of *finite* samples of the signal $\\{ x[n] | 0 \\leq n \\leq N\\} $. The most straight forward way to do that is as follows:\n",
    "Fix some constant $T_s$ that we shall call the sampling interval. The sampled signal is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x[n] = x(nT_s) , 0\\leq n \\leq N-1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens here? We got a descrete time signal, but what did we lose? It is obvious that we lost some information on the signal, but, with the great help of shannon and Nyquist we can show that if we sample fast enough, we will not loose information.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](AliasingSines.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Descretizing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Discrete Fourier Tranform (DFT) of a discrete time signal $x[n]$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-i \\frac{2 \\pi k n}{N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this have to do with frequencies??? In DFT we have a finite set of frequencies on which we evaluate the fourier transform - so \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k \\xrightarrow{} f_k = \\frac{k}{2N} f_s = \\frac{k}{2N T_s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this means that the our frequency range is limited to $f_{max} = f_{k=N-1} = \\frac{N-1}{2N} f_s $ - so we get to half of the sampling rate!\n",
    "\n",
    "FFT is a fast and efficient implementation of DFT and the terms are used interchangably."
